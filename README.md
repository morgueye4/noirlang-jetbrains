# Noirlang Plugin for JetBrains IDEs

Noirlang Plugin for JetBrains IDEs! This project aims to bring first-class development support for Noirlang directly into  JetBrains IDEs, such as RustRover, CLion, WebStorm, PyCharm, and more.

## Features (Planned/In Progress)
Our goal is to provide a comprehensive set of features that make Noirlang development in JetBrains IDEs a breeze.
Here's what we envision:

- Syntax Highlighting: Accurate and context-aware highlighting for Noirlang syntax.
- Intelligent Code Completion: Smart suggestions for keywords, variables, functions, and more.
- Error and Warning Detection: Real-time feedback on syntax errors, semantic issues, and potential problems.
- Code Navigation: Go-to-definition, find usages, and other navigation shortcuts.
